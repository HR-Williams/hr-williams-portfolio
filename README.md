## Known Bugs

* _Custom CSS was used to demonstrate knowldege of box model and floats. When this is not for an assignment I would like to change it to use bootstrap grid system._

* _More styling was done after my most recent push to gh-pages. GH-Pages and 'main' therefore don't match. If I decide I like main better, I will delete GH-pages branch and then push most recent changes to a new GH-pages branch._
